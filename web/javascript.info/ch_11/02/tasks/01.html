<!-- EXERCISE -->
<!--
Re-resolve a promise

What's the output of the code bellow?
```
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    resolve(1);
    
    setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 1000);
});

promise.then(alert);
```
!-->


<!-- SOLUTION -->
<!--
The output is: 1

The second call to `reslve` is ignored,
because only the first call of `reject/resolve` is taken into account.
Further calls are ignored.
