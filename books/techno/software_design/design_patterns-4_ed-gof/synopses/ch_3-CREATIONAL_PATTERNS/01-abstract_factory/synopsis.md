ABSTRACT FACTORY
================

Base
----

- a factory may be in a single instance (singleton)
- a factory may be abstract
- a factory may be with realized virtual methods
  (factory methods).

Often this pattern may be implemented as a set of factory methods.


Addition
--------

A factory can use a prototype pattern.
(It (factory) can be initialized with an object and then
 it (factory) can create a copy of this object).
