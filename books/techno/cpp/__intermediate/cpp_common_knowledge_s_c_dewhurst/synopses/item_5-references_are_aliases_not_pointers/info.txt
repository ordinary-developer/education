 references are aliases not pointers
 ###################################

 base
 ====

 a reference is another name for an existing object

 differences between references and pointers
 - there are no null references
 - all references require initialization
 - reference always refers to the object 
   with which it is initialized

 a reference is bound to its initializer for its whole lifetime

 when a reference to const is initialized with a literal,
 the reference is se to refer to a temporary location
 that is initialized with the literal
 
 odinarily, such temporaries are destroyed (that is, go out of scope
 and have their destructors called) at the end of the expression
 in which they're created;
 however, when such a temporary is used to initialized a reference
 to const, the temporary will exist as long as the reference that
 refers to it
