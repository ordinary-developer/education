 the "sys.path" is a list of directory name strings representning the true search path

 system defaults - when the interpreter is first started up.

 You can change this list with "append", "extend", "insert", "pop", "remove" and "del" operations.


 the loaded modules table
 ========================

 "sys.modules"
    is a dictionary containing one "name:module" entry for every
    module imported in your Python session or program

 "sys.builtin_module_names"
    is a list containing names of the modules built-in to the Python executable

 "sys.getrefcount"
    an object's reference count  
 

 exception details
 =================

 "sys.exc_info"
    a function returning a tuple with the latest exception's type,
    value, and tracebakc object.
