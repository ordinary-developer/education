other core types
================

sets 
----

sets are unordered collections of unique and immutable objects
they support the usual mathematical set operations

you create sets by calling the built-in "set" function or using 
new set literals and expressions in 3.X and 2.7 
(a curly braces syntax)

 
numeric types
-------------

"decimal" numbers are fixed-precision floating-point numbers

"fraction" numbers are rational numbers with both a numerator
and a denominator


booleans
--------

"booleans" are predefined "True" and "False" objects 
that are essentially just integers 1 and 0 
with custom display logic


None
----

"None" is a special placeholder object commonly used to initialize
names and objects
