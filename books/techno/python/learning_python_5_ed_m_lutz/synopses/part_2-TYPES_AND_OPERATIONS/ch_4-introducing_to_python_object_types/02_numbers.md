Numbers
=======

Types
-----

Python's types are:
- integers that have no fractional part;
- floating-point numbers that have a fractional part;
- complex numbers with imaginary parts;
- decimals with fixed precision;
- rationals with numerator and denominator;
- full-featured sets.

 
Operations
----------
 
Basic number operations are:
- the plus sign (+) performs addition;
- a star (/*) is used for multiplication;
- two stars (/**) are used for exponentiation.


Representation
--------------

There are two ways to print every object in Python
- with a full precision by using the "repr" function;
- in a user-friendly form by using the "str" function.
