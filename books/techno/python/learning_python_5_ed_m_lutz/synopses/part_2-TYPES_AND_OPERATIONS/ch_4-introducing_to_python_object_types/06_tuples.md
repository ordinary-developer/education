like strings

functionlally, they are used to represent
fixed collections of items

they are coded in parentheses, and they support 
arbitrary types, arbirtrary nesting,
and the usual sequence operations
 
methods 
- index(i) - return the element by the index
- count(element) - return the quantity of the element
