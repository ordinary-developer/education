Python's core data types
========================

Base material
-------------

Object types are
- numbers;
- strings;
- lists;
- dictionaries;
- tuples;
- files;
- sets;
- other core types (Booleans, types, None);
- program unit types (functions, modules, classes);
- implementations-related types (compiled code, stack tracebacks).

Python is dynamically typed and also is strongly typed.
