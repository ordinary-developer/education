# Chapter 3 - From Philosophy to Culture

## Four Presuppositions
- Everything is an object.
- Simulation of a problem domain drives object discovery and definition.
- Objects must be composable.
- Distributed cooperation and communication
  must replace hierarchical centralized control
  as an organizational paradigm.

Eliminating centralized control is one of the hardest lessons
to be learned by object developers.

## Rule Object
A rule is an ordered collection of constants, variables, and operations.
A variable consists of an object and a message to be sent to that object.
When a variable sends the message to the target,
the resultant value replaces the unknown value of the variable.
When asked to evaluate to a result, a rule iterates across its elements,
asking each variable to instantiate itself to a real value,
and then applies the operators to the instantiated variables and constants.
